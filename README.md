# SearchEngine
This project implements a basic search engine in C programming 
language. The search engine utilizes a Trie data structure for efficient 
storage and retrieval of words.
# Features
1) Indexing: Capability to index a predefined set of words during 
initialization.
2) Search: Ability to search for words in the indexed dataset.
3) User Interaction: Provides a user-friendly interface for users to 
interact with the search engine, allowing them to perform search 
queries.
# Main function

words into it.
• Provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface for users to 
perform search queries.
• Supports searching for words in the indexed dataset.
 The program continues to execute until the user chooses to
